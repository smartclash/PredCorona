# PredCorona

***A simple corona cases predictor***

---

Hi, I am [AlphaMan](https://twitter.com/@xXAlphaManXx). I made this small website in two hours or less just because I was bored of quarantine days. This whole website is made using Javascript and has no backend powering it.

The prediction is based on the formula `y = ab^x` where `a` will be the case count of present day, `b` will be the growth factor and `x` will be the number of day from today for when you want to predict.

Since this formula can plot only exponential growth, it cannot really find out when the growth stalls and flattens because we are practicing various measures such as Social Distancing, Staying at Home etc. If you would love to learn more, I recommend checking out these videos
